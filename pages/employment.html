      <h2>AI/ML Systems Engineer</h2>
      <h5>Leonardo UK, Sep 2023 - present</h5>
      <p>
        I have spent the majority of my time developing a classification model to identify targets from radar data, 
        while also exploring approaches to certifying machine learning systems. This work involved investigating validation and verification methods
        to ensure models are robust, explainable, and suitable for real-world deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my technical contributions, I have helped organise internal hackathons and received a special mention at the company's
        Innovation Awards for this. I have also collaborated with key stakeholders across the organisation to produce a top-down roadmap for the 
        AI/ML function.

      <h2>Masters Student</h2>
      <h5>Institute of Bioengineering for Catalonia (IBEC), Nov 2021 - Jan 2022 </h5>
      <p>Completed my master’s project at a bioengineering facility in Barcelona, developing a microfluidic stretching device for cells. 
        I improved upon lab skills producing cell cultures, as well as fabrication techniques to design the stretching device itself, including use of a 3D printer. Designed the mould using SolidWorks CAD and implemented MATLAB code to quantify cell strain 
        by analyzing before-and-after images captured using a microscope. <p>
