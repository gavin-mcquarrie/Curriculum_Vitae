      <h2>AI/ML Systems Engineer</h2>
      <h5>Leonardo UK, Sep 2023 - present</h5>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      <p>
        I have spent the majority of my time developing a classification model to identify targets from radar data, 
        while also exploring approaches to certifying machine learning systems. This work involved investigating validation and verification methods
        to ensure models are robust, explainable, and suitable for real-world deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my technical contributions, I have helped organise internal hackathons and received a special mention at the company's
        Innovation Awards for this. I have also collaborated with key stakeholders across the organisation to produce a top-down roadmap for the 
        AI/ML function.

      <h2>Masters Student</h2>
      <h5>Institute of Bioengineering for Catalonia (IBEC), Nov 2021 - Jan 2022 </h5>
      <p>Completed my masters project at a bioengineering facility in Barcelona fabricating a miro-fluidic stretching 
          device for cells. Lab techniques to deal with proper curation and handling of cells, fabrication techniques
          (curation of silicone, creation of mould using 3D printer...). Practical experience using Solidworks CAD to design
          the mould, used MATLAB to produce code which measured the strain of the cells using before/after images of the cells. <p>
