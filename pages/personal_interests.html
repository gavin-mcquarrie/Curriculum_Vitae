      <p> From a young age, I have had a strong interest in sport. Growing up, I competed at regional level in badminton and at national level
         in tennis, while also playing football and golf. Although I now tend to watch more sport than I play, I stay active through running and 
         gym training and still enjoy participating in any sport when the opportunity arises.
      </p>
      <p> I am currently a recruit in the Royal Marines Reserves, training for the Commando tests in May 2025. Training takes place weekly 
        at my local detachment, with 2.5-day exercises held every other weekend. The experience has been highly rewarding, allowing me to 
        push my physical and mental limits while developing discipline and resilience.
      </p>
      <p> Since I was young I have had a keen interest in a variety of sports. Growing up I played at regional and national level for badminton and tennis, respectively, while
          I also enjoyed playing football and golf. Nowadays I'm usually watching sport on TV rather than playing it and choose to get my exercise running or at 
          the gym, however, I still do like to play when I can (whatever the sport!)
      <p> I purchased a BMW F850GS in August 2024, shortly after obtaining my motorcycle licence in March of the same year, 
        fulfilling a long-term ambition to own a motorbike. I enjoy using it to explore different parts of the country and value 
        the sense of freedom that riding provides. </p>
      <p> Like many people, I have a strong passion for travel. After finishing high school, I spent a year in Australia at the age of 19, 
        which sparked a lasting interest in exploring new countries and cultures. Since then, I have been fortunate to travel extensively 
        through both academic and professional opportunities, including studying in North Carolina during my third year of university, 
        completing my master’s project in Barcelona, and spending several months in Rome studying a business degree as part of my graduate 
        programme. Outside of work, I have travelled to various European countries and recently visited Thailand and Cambodia at the end of 2024.
      </p>
      <p> Some of my long-term personal goals include achieving conversational fluency in another language (I realise this is a popular one!). 
        Outside of work, I am also developing a personal project focused on building a fantasy football website.</p>
