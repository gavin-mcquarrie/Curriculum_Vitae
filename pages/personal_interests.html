      <p> I bought a BMW F850GS in August 2024 after getting my license in March of the same year to fulfill a long-term ambition of owning a motorbike.
          I enjoy exploring different parts of the country on the bike and enjoy the feeling of freedom you get when riding.
      </p>
      <p> I passed the Royal Marines fitness assessment in February 2025 and hope to embark on training in the near future
          with my local reserves unit.
      </p>
      <p> Since I was young I have had a keen interest in a variety of sports. Growing up I played at regional and national level for badminton and tennis, respectively, while
          I also enjoyed playing football and golf. Nowadays I'm usually watching sport on TV rather than playing it and choose to get my exercise running or at 
          the gym, however, I still do like to play when I can (whatever the sport!)
      <p> Like many others I love to travel. After I finished High School, I spent a year in Australia at the age of 19. I caught the travel bug after this and have taken every opportunity to travel since then and have been fortunate enough to travel through academia and work: I spent my 3rd year of university
      studying in North Carolina, completed my final year's master project in Barcelona and spent several months in Rome studying a business degree as part of my graduate programme. Outside of work, I have visited a few other countries 
      in Europe (although I have many more to see) and recently visited Thailand and Cambodia at the end fo 2024. </p>
      <p> Some of my personal goals for the future include learning to speak another language at conversational level and starting a business.</p>
