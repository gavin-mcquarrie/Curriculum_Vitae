    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h5>Last updated on 19/12/2025</h5>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Masters of Engineering degree in Biomedical Engineering (obtaining a 2:1).
      Since then I have been working as a Systems Engineer at Leonardo UK in the AI/ML team within the electronics division at the Edinburgh site.
      I have mainly worked with computer vision models and experimenting with synthetic data as a way to improve object detection models 
      and help solve the continuing issue of lack of data.
    <p>During my time at Leonardo, I also studied for and earned an Executive Masters degree in Advanced Management with a major in Global Business, which 
      gave me a new perspective as I learned the basics of business and how to effectively work with others.</p>
