    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h5>Last updated on 19/12/2025</h5>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Glasgow in 2022 with an MEng in Biomedical Engineering (2:1). Since then, I have worked as a 
      Machine Learning Engineer at Leonardo UK within the AI/ML team in the Electronics Division, where I develop and deploy machine 
      learning solutions in a safety-critical, regulated environment.
    <p>My role has focused on the design, training, evaluation, and documentation of machine learning models, primarily for computer vision 
      and signal-based applications. I have taken responsibility for building end-to-end model development pipelines, including dataset 
      curation, experimentation, performance analysis, and communication of results to multidisciplinary stakeholders. A significant part of 
      my work has involved addressing real-world data challenges, such as limited and noisy datasets, through techniques including 
      synthetic data generation.</p>
    <p>Alongside my technical role, I completed an Executive Master’s degree in Advanced Management (Global Business), which strengthened 
      my ability to work effectively across technical and non-technical teams, contribute to design discussions, and understand the broader 
      product, quality, and business context in which machine learning systems are developed and delivered.</p>
